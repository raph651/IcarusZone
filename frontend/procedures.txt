## 1: npm start takes long time to compile and run

Each 'npm start' command run takes about 2mins, and there is warning:

---
(node:22848) [DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_AFTER_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onAfterSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 'setupMiddlewares' option.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
(node:22848) [DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_BEFORE_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onBeforeSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 'setupMiddlewares' option.
---

# still no obvious solution. Might be WSL2 running on windows path, slowing down the performance.


## 2: npm server doesn't reload after saving changes

Changing content in the App.js doesn't immediately make the server reload the page

#solution :

@package.json:

from 
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",

to
  "scripts": {
    "start": "WATCHPACK_POLLING=true react-scripts start",

## 3. concatenate className with variable doesn't work

Example: className = "text"+ item.color, "navitem".
        where item.color = "purple-200"

# solution: className = {classNames("text"+item.color, "navitem")}

or className = item.color, "navitem".
        where item.color = "text-purple-200"

## 4. Navigation active page link doesn't work with aria-current='page'

Problem: wanted to create an flex box under the active navigation item, 
for example, navbar:    main Page, employees, Team, Projects 
                                  [-------]
active nav is emplyees.

However, in order to use aria-current, need to use useState() variable and function to update/set aria-current.

Solution: use <NavLink>, such that using the 'className = { ({isActive}) => {}}' to create dynamic page update function.
```
                        className={({ isActive }) => {
                          const active = isActive;

                          return classNames(
                            active ? "class1" : "class2",
                            "classContinue..."
                          );
                        }}
```


## 5. ---:after{}--- styling. 

define new element showing up besides the original element
For example, 
nav{
    display: flex space-x-4;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    margin: auto;
}

.navitem:after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    background-color: #7dd3fc;
    height: 3px;
    width: 0;
    left:10px;
    bottom: 0px;
    transition: 0.3s;
}

'.navitem:after' will create a new flex box, with specification of '.navitem' and '.navitem:after' class

## 6. 'POST' error message=>: 'http://localhost:8000/api/customer/24/ 500 (Internal Server Error)'
and 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON'

Problem : tried to editCustomer and then fetch to backend using 'POST' method. The 'Content-Type' in headers 
is already set to be 'application/json', still not working.

Reason: the 500 error comes from views.customer doesn't have the permission for 'POST'

Solution: add 'POST' method to views.customer function

## 6. App.js can't resolve the function from components.

--> Problem: 
  Defined a function start with lowercase letter (like newPage) in scr/pages/newPage.js

  Specifically, newPage.js looks like
```
    export default function newPage(){
      return ....;
    }
```
  In App.js,
```
    import newPage from "./pages/newPage";

    ...

    <Route path=... element = {<newPage/>} />

    ...

```

However, the newPage function can't be resolved and it was not used in App.js.

--> Reason: All React component names must start with a capital letter. If you start a component name with 
a lowercase letter, it will be treated as a built-in element like a <div> or a <span>. This is because of the way JSX works.

--> Solve: replace the function name starting with upppercase letter ( newPage -> NewPage )
