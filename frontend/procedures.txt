## 1: npm start takes long time to compile and run

Each 'npm start' command run takes about 2mins, and there is warning:

---
(node:22848) [DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_AFTER_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onAfterSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 'setupMiddlewares' option.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
(node:22848) [DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_BEFORE_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onBeforeSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 'setupMiddlewares' option.
---

# still no obvious solution. Might be WSL2 running on windows path, slowing down the performance.


## 2: npm server doesn't reload after saving changes

Changing content in the App.js doesn't immediately make the server reload the page

#solution :

@package.json:

from 
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",

to
  "scripts": {
    "start": "WATCHPACK_POLLING=true react-scripts start",
